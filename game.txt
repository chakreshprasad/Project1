#Games
A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.

Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship.
